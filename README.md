# Mateusz Filipowicz's Blog

This is a blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). 
It's designed to be simple, fast, and customizable. 
You can find here my thoughts, experiences, and guides on various topics.

I write without bullshit, directly to the point, mostly about software development, technology, 
leadership and other topics that interest me.
